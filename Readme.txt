How to use this website.

This website provides a configurable registration form.

At the top we have a menu with the following links:

Home: takes user to the home page

Registration: gives user the option to open the registration form

Field Config: which is used to configure form field visibility

Note: If you tick any fields on the Visible column, that field will show on the form
You will need to click on the Save button to perist that configuration.
(this is stored in a json file in the App_Data folder)
